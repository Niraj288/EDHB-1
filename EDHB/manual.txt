INSTALLATION

1) Open main_input
2) Point path to local mode if present
3) Point path to babel

Make sure to add this path in the bashrc or bash_profile 

The program is now ready to run!


BASIC SYNTAX

EDHB filename.extension

extension can be any babel compatible file such as pdb, mol2, xyz, pdbqt, fchk etc.


PARAMETERS

The following parameters can be provided for external calculations

Parameters that require no external file

1) -c to include C-H...O bonds
2) -l for local mode calculation
3) -f for local frequency calculation 
4) -Charg for charges from .fchk file generated from gaussian (Mulliken charges)
5) -R to do Intramolecular analysis
6) -a to add HB angle
7) -B to add bifurcation type

Parameters that require additional files

1) -Hl hessian_file
hessian_file should have the first line as comment followed by upper triangle of hessian
hessian can have line breaks, however, should be space separated
Check examples/external_hessian/hessian for an example input

2) -d AIMALL_file
AIMALL_file that contains information about Bond Critical Points (BCP) (.sum, .sumviz, .mgpviz etc.)

3) -C NBO_file
NBO_file is the output for an NBO analysis from gaussian 
The parameter adds NBO charges to participating hydrogen bond atoms

4) -LP NBO_file
NBO_file is the output for an NBO analysis from gaussian 
The parameter adds lone pair contributions 

5) -db pdb_id 
pdb_id is the ID for a protein taken from Protein Data Bank
The parameter adds secondary structure informations


EXAMPLES

1) water_cluster
EDHB cluster.fchk -d cluster.mgpviz -LP cluster.g09.out -C cluster.g09.out -l –f

2) Proteins
EDHB 1k43.pdb –db 1K43 –R –B

3) External Hessian
EDHB xtbopt.xyz -Hl hessian -l -f
